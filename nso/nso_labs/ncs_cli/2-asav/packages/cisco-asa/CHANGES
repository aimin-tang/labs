cisco-asa v5.5.4 [2017-10-06]
=============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

    WARNING:
    When using cisco-asa with other NEDs, certain combinations of NED versions
    may cause 'random' Exceptions. The reason for this is the introduction of
    a new common NED component - nedcom.jar - which initially was located in
    shared-jar, but later moved to private-jar. However, since the JAVA loader
    looks in shared-jar directories first, a newer NED with nedcom.jar in
    private-jar will still load another NED's older nedcom.jar in shared-jar;
    causing a version conflict and quite possibly an Exception.

    Hence, if you are using a newer NED (with private-jar/nedcom.jar) you must
    make sure no other NEDs in your project has a shared-jar/nedcom.jar. If they
    do, you must upgrade them to a version which also has nedcom in private-jar.

    The following NED versions have their nedcom.jar in shared-jar:

    a10-acos      3.6.5
    alu-sr        6.0.2 to 6.1.1
    cisco-asa     5.2 to to 5.2.1
    cisco-ios     5.2.8 to 5.4.2
    cisco-iosxr   6.0 to 6.1
    cisco-nx      4.4.7 to 4.5.2
    huawei-vrp    4.2.6

    In short, avoid the above NED versions when using other NEDs.

Enhancements:

Corrections:

  - Fixed transaction id problem with secrets and show-checksum option.
    (ASA-116)

  - Redisable terminal pager in exec mode if pager configured in config mode.
    (ASA-115 / RT30210)

  - Fixed problem with NED deadlocking and timing out if empty access-list
     erronously configured.
    (ASA-115 / RT30210)

    (RT30198)


cisco-asa v5.5.3 [2017-10-05]
=============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

Corrections:

  - Fixed problem with service-policy config causing order dependency issues
     with policy-map vs class-map and access-list vs object-group.
    (ASA-112, RT30143, ASA-113 / RT30167)

  - Do not throw an exception if config is not saved with use-startup-config
     in order to avoid a recently (v5.3.3) introduced problem where a failed
     transaction did not rollback properly.
    (ASA-110 / RT30127)

  - Fixed order dependency between:
     access-list *
     object-group *
    (ASA-109 / RT30113

  - Send 'changeto system' when leaving 'changeto context' context in order
     to be able to continue modify system config in same transaction.

    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Removed cli-show-no on:
     interface * / nameif
     interface * / security-level
      Note: if an interface is created with these leaves set, a fix will be
            needed to clear them.
    (ASA-107 / RT29975)

Corrections:

  - Restored trimming of commands sent to device (broken in v5.5).
    (ASA-107 / RT29975)


cisco-asa v5.5 [2017-09-18]
===========================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Added support for commit dry-run without connecting to device.
    (ASA-105)

     policy-map * / class * / set connection advanced-options <tcp-map>
     policy-map * / parameters / tcp-inspection
     timeout igp stale-route
    (ASA-104 / RT29935)

  - Rewrote the access-list code from scratch to:
     - No longer use a show command on device to read the old list
     - Be more liberate in accepting diffset from NSO; by ignoring already
       existing access-list entries, except for updating the insert index.
     - Show what the NED will send to the device in commit dry-run.
    (ASA-102 / RT29895, ASA-103)

     interface * / security-level
     interface * / ip address
    (ASA-98 / RT29863)


cisco-asa v5.4 [2017-09-13]
===========================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Inject delete of context disk file in transaction when context is deleted
     or when context config-url is (re)set and new ned-setting cisco-asa auto
     context-config-url-file-delete is set to true (default). Hence in this case
     all config must come from NSO and not a pre-existing context config file.
    (ASA-99 / RT29864)

  - Added support for "?" in 'live-status exec any' and 'config exec' commands
     in order to be able to show help menus.
    (ASA-95)

  - Added a new optional method to calculate transaction id:
     cisco-asa-transaction-id-method config-hash-cached
      Same as config-hash except that transaction id method will reuse
      the last unmodified config from show (sync-from).
    (ASA-93)

     loopback-proxy server
     loopback-proxy client syslog
     arp permit-nonconnected
      Changed from cli-show-no type empty leaf to cli-boolean-no type boolean
      leaf to avoid sending down unsupported config to new context.
    (ASA-99 / RT29864)

  - Corrected badly placed cli-show-no on pager lines to assure that
     'no pager lines' is sent down on a newly created context.
    (ASA-99 / RT29864)

  - Fixed compare-config diff and problem setting 'enable password'.
    Removed erronous support for enable password with level.
    (ASA-97 / RT29860)

  - Fixed two problems with long banners:
     Bad dequoting of string causing lost characters.
     NED was blocked on ^H characters generated in echo for long strings.
    (ASA-96 / RT29853)


cisco-asa v5.3.3 [2017-09-08]
=============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Removed the cisco-asa admin-device reuse ned-setting and
    introduced a new ned-setting; cisco-asa admin-device method
     which is used to configure which method should be used to pull
     the context config from an admin device.
    (ASA-84 / RT29248)

  - Added cisco-asa admin-device number-of-retries and
     cisco-asa admin-device time-between-retry ned-settings to
     enable retrying if admin SSH connect fails.

     devices device platform serial-number
      Note: Only supported by newer NSO versions.
    (ASA-91)

Corrections:

  - API CHANGE:
     policy-map * / class * / set connection timeout idle
      Changed time leaf type from hhmm-type to string with pattern.
    (ASA-90 / RT29679)

  - API CHANGE
     icmp *
      Combined deny and permit lists to a single ordered-by user list.
      NOTE: Since the list is ordered per interface, the command ordering
            had to be changed to: icmp <nameif> <rule>. NED will swap order
            to device order when writing and reading.
    (ASA-88 / RT29546)


cisco-asa v5.3.1 [August 18, 2017]

cisco-asa v5.3 [August 11, 2017]
==================================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     timeout conn-holddown
    (ASA-87 / RT29451)

  - API CHANGE:
     Changed admin-device ned-setting config from specific info to just the
     name of the admin device. Hence new connection example looks like this:
      devices device asa5545-ctx ned-settings cisco-asa admin-device name asa5545-adm
    (ASA-84 / RT29248)

  - Do not open admin-device SSH connection until needed, i.e. reading config.
    Close admin-device SSH connection immediately after use, unless the new
     ned-setting cisco-asa admin-device reuse is set to true.
    (ASA-84 / RT29248)

Corrections:

  - Moved nedcom.jar from shared-jar to private-jar directory.

cisco-asa v5.2 [July 28, 2017]
==============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     flow-export active refresh-interval
     flow-export delay flow-create
     flow-export destination *
     flow-export template timeout-rate
     policy-map * / class * / flow-export event-type * destination *
    (ASA-85 / RT29249)

  - Implemented 'cisco-asa get-device-config-settings use-startup-config'
    ned-setting in order to force the NED to retrieve startup-config only, i.e.
    saved config. This can be used to avoid a race condition when a 2nd connection
    is used to retrieve config, which occurs if the latest transaction was not
    saved yet.
    (ASA-83 / RT29234)

  - Added new feature for optimizing sync-from (and compare-config).
    Enable with ned-setting 'cisco-asa extended-parser turbo-mode'.
    (ASA-81)

Corrections:

  - Close secondary admin connection/session in close method.
    (ASA-84 / RT29248)


cisco-asa v5.1.1 [June 24, 2017]
================================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     context * / join-failover-group
     failover group * / primary|secondary
     failover group * / preempt
    (ASA-82 / RT28808)

Corrections:

    (ASA-77 / RT28639)


cisco-asa v5.1 [June 15, 2017]
==============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.<

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     crypto dynamic-map * set reverse-route
     crypto map * set ikev1 transform-set
     crypto isakmp identity
     webvpn / cache / disable
    (ASA-80 / RT28750)

  - Read device-profile from devices device <devname> device-profile.
    Default to cisco-asa.
    (ASA-78)

  - Implemented support for a secondary (admin) connection with single context
    logins on multiple-mode devices (i.e. using cisco-asa-context-name). The
    admin connection (must use SSH) is used to list configuration using the
    more command from system context, thereby also showing cleartext passwords.
    Example of how to configure a connection to an admin connection:
     devices device asa5545-ctx ned-settings cisco-asa admin-device address 1.2.3.4
     devices device asa5545-ctx ned-settings cisco-asa admin-device port 22
     devices device asa5545-ctx ned-settings cisco-asa admin-device remote-name cisco
     devices device asa5545-ctx ned-settings cisco-asa admin-device remote-password cisco
     devices device asa5545-ctx ned-settings cisco-asa admin-device remote-secondary-password cisco
    WARNING: Running-config must be saved or more command will not be used, i.e
             make sure to have cisco-asa-write-memory-setting set to on-commit.
    (ASA-77 / RT28639)

Corrections:

  - API CHANGE:
     webvpn / error-recovery disable
      Changed from enum to boolean leaf to support 'no error-recovery disable'
    (ASA-80 / RT28750)

  - Fixed bug with "snmp-server group|host" and Nedsecrets.
    (ASA-79)


cisco-asa v5.0.8 [May 19, 2017]
===============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

     aaa-server * host * / server-port
     policy-map * / class * / inspect http
     tcp-map * / tcp-options range *
     timeout * sctp
    (ASA-73 / RT27864)

Corrections:

  - Removed order-by user on object-group network * / network-object list to
     avoid ending up with empty list while modiyfing it.
    Added object-group/network tailf:cli-diff-dependency on nat list.
    (ASA-72)

  - Strip meta-data prefix in NedSecrets if shown, to avoid bad regexp.
    Fixed problem with TACACS+ key secret by escaping + in key name(s).

=================================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Added "| noprompts" option to live-status exec commands in order to be able
     to ignore (erronously) triggered question prompts. Also added 'IGNORE' as
     an option to '| prompts' in order to specify what prompts to ignore.
    (ASA-69)

Corrections:

  - Revisited: Fixed problem with live-status exec any "packet-tracer input"
    (ASA-68 / RT27376)

Enhancements:

  - Support for NedSecrets on non-transaction id setups.
    (ASA-65)

  - Changed ned-setting log format.

Corrections:

  - Discontinued support for NSO-4.3 due to NSO bug. Use NSO-4.3.1.


cisco-asa v5.0.1 [January 13, 2017]
===================================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

    WARNING:
    Using NSO-4.3 branch you must upgrade to minimum NSO-4.3.0.2 in order for
    NedSecrets to work. If you are not, you will get a compare-config diff
    when setting cleartext passwords which the device encrypts.
    The problem can also be seen in the logs as an exception:
      "... com.tailf.cdb.CdbException: Not a cdb operational data path"

Enhancements:

  - Assert that terminal width is either 0 or 511 upon connect in order to
     avoid issues with NSO blocking due to too low terminal width.
    (ASA-63)

Corrections:

  - Fixed problem with error detection mechanism matching command echo by
     increasing the match echo line length from 50 to 500. NOTE: terminal
     width must always be set to 511 in day 0 (See README).
    (ASA-63)

cisco-asa v5.0 [December 22, 2016]
==================================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

    WARNING:
    NedSecrets does not work with NSO-4.3 yet. Due to this, there will be
    config diffs on some config. To solve this issue, a new NSO-4.3. will
    be needed.

Enhancements:

  - Rewrote the implementation for supporting device encrypted data in order
     to support commit queues.
    (ASA-60)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     snmp-server user * engineID

    of out of sync or config diff due to the reverse transaction failing too.

  - Improved performance for modifying access-list by reducing the
     number of show run access-list calls to the device.
    (ASA-45 / RT25014)

  - access-list improvements:
     Do not accept extended rules ending with whitespace.
     Exclude 'access-list * does not exist' to avoid logging expected "errors".


Corrections:


cisco-asa v4.2 [September 25, 2016]
===================================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

=============================

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     password encryption aes
   (RT22672)

  - Implemented support for replacing encrypted device secrets with the
    cleartext cdb value in order to avoid compare-config diff and out of
    sync with service. The new design requires support for tailf:meta-data
    which means the minimum NCS/NSO versions had to be raised accordingly.
    All transformed secrets on the device should now be supported.
   (RT22672)

  - Added support for passing answers to prompts in live-status exec and
    config exec commands. Append '| prompts <answer1> [answer2]' to command.
    Note: For hitting enter only on a prompt, add the prompt key 'ENTER'

     modify changes on active sla monitor, requring temporary delete of
     sla monitor schedule.
    (RT22176)

  - API CHANGE:
     object network * / nat
    Changed from multi-word-key to specific in order to support dependencies.

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Added support for direct use of single context on multiple-mode device.
    Example of how to specify the single context 'FOO':
    devices device <devname> ned-settings cisco-asa-context-name FOO
    (RT22791)

  - Use 'more disk0:/<context>.cfg file if multi-context admin and context
    config is saved in order to show pre-shared secrets in cleartext.

  - Added 'any' exec command and optional context name under live-status
    to be able to execute any ASA command in any context on the device.
    For example:
    devices device <devname> live-status exec any context FOO "show ver"
    NOTE: Only works if logged in as multi-context admin.

  - Added support for all config exec commands under 'exec'. For example,
    to run a command in config mode, type: 'exec clear configure dns'.
    Also added support for optional context change prior to running the
    command, e.g.: 'exec context FOO clear configure dns'

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     interface * / ospf message-digest-key *
     interface * / ospf authentication
