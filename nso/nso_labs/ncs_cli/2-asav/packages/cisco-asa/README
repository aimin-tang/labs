1. Introduction
---------------

   This document describes the NED for Cisco ASA devices.

   The NED connects to the device CLI using either SSH or Telnet.
   Configuration is done by sending native CLI commands to the
   device through the communication channel.

   WARNING:

   In order for the NED to work pager must be disabled and the terminal
   width must be configured directly on the device (using TELNET/SSH
   login) to maximum width:
   asav-1(config)# pager lines 0
   asav-1(config)# terminal width 511
   asav-1(config)# write memory


2. Getting started
------------------

   Set up the environment in $DIR, change DIR to something suitable

     > tar xvzf ned-cisco-asa.tgz
     > mv ned-cisco-asa $NCS_DIR/packages/neds/

     > export DIR=/tmp/ncs-cisco-asa
     > ncs-setup --ned-package $NCS_DIR/packages/neds/cisco-asa --dest $DIR
     > cd $DIR

   Start ncs:
     > ncs

   Start NCS CLI:
     > ncs_cli -C -u admin


3. Configure device in NCS
--------------------------

   In the NCS CLI configure the device. Enter configuration mode:
     # configure

   Set the required configurables, address, remote user data including
   remote secondary password, if needed:
     # devices device asav address <device address>
     # devices device asav device-type cli ned-id cisco-asa
     # devices device asav state admin-state unlocked

   Set port and protocol:
     # devices device asav port <typically 22 or 23>
     # devices device asav device-type cli protocol <telnet or ssh>

   Set authgroup:
     # devices authgroups group auth-groupname umap admin remote-name <login username>
     # devices authgroups group auth-groupname umap admin remote-password <login password>
     # devices device asav authgroup auth-groupname
     # commit

   Optional debug and trace configurables:

     Make the NED dump allCLI messages sent to/from the XR device
     # devices global-settings trace raw
     # commit

     Make the NED print debug log messages
     # java-vm java-logging logger com.tailf.packages.ned.asa level level-debug
     # commit

   Exit configure mode:
     # exit

   Try to connect to the device:
     # devices device asav connect

   Read the configuration from the device:
     # devices device asav sync-from

   Look at the configuration:
     # show running-config devices device asav


4. Sample Device Configuration
------------------------------

   For instance, create a second Loopback interface that is down:

   admin@ncs(config)# devices device asav config
   admin@ncs(config-config)# hostname mynewhostname

   See what you are about to commit:

   admin@ncs(config-config)# commit dry-run outformat native
   device asav-1
     hostname mynewhostname

   Commit new configuration in a transaction:

   admin@ncs(config-config)# commit
   Commit complete.

   Verify that NCS is in-sync with the device:

    admin@ncs(config-config)# devices device asav check-sync
    result in-sync

   Compare configuration between device and NCS:

    admin@ncs(config-config)# devices device asav compare-config
    admin@ncs(config-config)#

   Note: If no diff is shown, supported config is the same in
         NCS as on the device.


5. Configure the NED - ned-settings
-----------------------------------

  The cisco-asa NED behaviour can be configured using the
  cisco-asa-XXX ned-settings config, located in three different
  locations; global, profile and device specific:

  /ncs:devices/global-settings/ned-settings/
  /ncs:devices/ncs:profiles/profile:<profile name>/ned-settings/
  /ncs:/device/devices/device:<dev name>/ned-settings/

  Note: profiles setting overrides global-settings and device settings
  override profile settings, hence the narrowest scope of the setting
  is used.

  Note: if you change a ned-setting you must reconnect to the device,
  i.e. disconnect and connect in order for the new setting to take effect.

  See following sections for information about various ned-settings.


6. Execute native device command
--------------------------------

   The NED has support for all native ASA exec commands using the
   devices device live-status exec any command

   To execute a command, run it in NCS exec mode like this:

    admin@ncs# devices device asav live-status exec any "show
       running-config hostname"
    result
    hostname myhostname
    myhostname#

   If the command prompts the user for input you can append the
   answer(s) using '| prompts <answer 1> <answer N>'
   For example:

   devices device asav live-status exec any "reload | prompts yes yes"

   An alternative way to pass answer to prompts is using
   ned-settings cisco-asa-auto-prompts, which is a way to register
   standard answers to standard questions. Note: auto-prompts are
   checked after '| prompts'. Example settings:

   devices global-settings ned-settings cisco-asa-auto-prompts Q1 question "System configuration has been modified" answer "no"
   devices global-settings ned-settings cisco-asa-auto-prompts Q2 question "Do you really want to remove these keys" answer "yes"
   devices global-settings ned-settings cisco-asa-auto-prompts Q3 question "Press RETURN to continue" answer ENTER

   Note: ENTER means a carriage return + line feed is sent to the device.
   NOTE: IGNORE means the prompt was not a question and parsing continue.
   Note: A one letter answer is sent without line feed.

   Finally, use "| noprompts" if all prompts should be ignored,
   e.g. show command only.


7. Standard cisco-asa ned-settings
----------------------------------

  - cisco-asa-transaction-id-method

    The method to use by the NED for calculating transaction ID. Three
    methods are supported:

    config-hash
      Calculate MD5 on a snapshot of the entire running config for
      calculation. (Default)

    show-checksum
      Use built in 'show checksum' Cryptochecksum.

    config-hash-cached
      Same as config-hash except that transaction id method will reuse
      the last unmodified config from show (sync-from).


  - cisco-asa-write-memory-setting

    This setting is used to configure how and when an applied config
    is saved to persistent memory on the device. Two methods are
    supported:

    on-commit
      Save configuration immediately after the config has been
      successfully applied on the device. If an error occurs when saving
      the whole running config will be rolled back (default)

    disabled
      Disable saving the applied config to persistent memory.


  - cisco-asa get-device-config-settings use-startup-config

    This setting is used to change the method for retrieving
    config. The normal procedure is to check whether the config is
    saved, and if it is, list the saved file using 'more'. And if it
    is not saved, the current configuration is shown using show
    running-config. Setting this method to true however, will change
    the behaviour of the NED to always show the saved file, regardless
    of whether the current configuration is newer. This can be useful
    to avoid a race condition if multiple NCS clients are used.


  - cisco-asa extended-parser turbo-mode turbo-mode|disable [default]

    This setting can be use with NSO-4.4.1 or newer to optimize
    sync-from and compare-config. Set to turbo-mode to enable.


  - cisco-asa admin-device name

    Set with single context use to specify an admin device name used
    to retrieve device secrets using the more command.


  - cisco-asa admin-device method

    maapi
      The admin session is opened as an NSO action, hence can be
      reused until connection thread timeout.
    ssh
      The admin session is opened as direct SSH connection and
      immediately closed after config is read.

  - cisco-asa auto context-config-url-file-delete false|true (default)

    This ned-setting is used to inject a delete of pre-existing
    context config-url file when context * / config-url is (re)set.
    By default it is set to true to avoid problem with pre-existing
    config if creating and initializing a context in same transaction.
    Hence if this ned-setting is set to false, a sync-from must be
    performed after setting the config-url file.


8. context configuration
------------------------

  There are three ned-settings used to configure contexts in the cisco
  asa NED:

  The cisco-asa-context-list can be used to configure supported
  contexts for admin restricted admin logins. The context name(s) can
  be specified using a regexp expression.

  The cisco-asa-context-name ned-setting can be used to specify a
  the context name for a single context login on a multiple mode
  device.

  The cisco-asa admin-device ned-settings can be used to specify a
  secondary SSH connection to the admin login on a single context
  device (i.e. using the cisco-asa-context-name setting). The reason
  for the admin connection is to be allowed to read secrets using the
  more command. WARNING: Running-config must be saved or more command
  will not be used, i.e make sure to have
  cisco-asa-write-memory-setting set to on-commit.
